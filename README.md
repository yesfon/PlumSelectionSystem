# PlumSelectionSystem
This repository is made up of two main elements, the first is a data set that is made up of images taken from post-harvest samples of the fruit known as plum, specifically of the horvin variety.
The description of the data set is as follows:

- First class plums: 606 samples
- Second class plums: 705 samples
- Third class plums: 557 samples

The second element is composed of two codes made in jupyter notebook. The first `CNN_MULTI.ipynb` is the training of a convolutional neural network that allowed to solve the classification of plums in three different categories. The code shows the metrics obtained in training and validation, where around 92% accuracy is obtained for the validation set. The model that was saved after training the algorithm is also available in the file `CNN_Plum.h5`
